# Pong
Classic "pong" arcade game.

## What is this?
This is a replica of the popular arcade game known as 'Pong'. The player controls a paddle on the left side of the screen and repeatedly hits a ball back to the opponent's side of the screen. The player does not want the ball to pass their paddle.\
If the ball passes the player's side of the screen or the opponent's side, the opponent gains a point or the player gains one point, respectively. The first one to reach 5 points wins.\
\
This project was made in Unity version 2022.3. 

## How do I install?
This project is completely open-source, which means everything that you need to play is included in the downloadable .zip for this project.\

## How do I play?
The controls are even simpler than the installation process:\
